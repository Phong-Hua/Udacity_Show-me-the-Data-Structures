The structure of group is similar to a tree, which each user is consider a leaf, each sub group is consider a branch.
The depth of this tree is k, and each node has m child nodes. Number of nodes in this tree is k^m.
To find a user is in the group is similar to find a leaf with specific value in a tree, this would search entire tree.
The time complexity to find a user in a group is O(k^m). Assume total number of nodes in this tree is n. 
Then time complexity is O(n). This is linear complexity.

For space complexity, at a group, it get all users and sub_groups of that group, which is equal to number of node of that branch.
Hence, the space complexity will be equal to number of nodes in this tree k^m, or O(n), which is linear complexity.
